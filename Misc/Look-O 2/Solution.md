# Solution

This is the part2 of this serie of challenges.
in the first part we found the flag in the youtube account of "loco avocado"

But as i always say, description can give us hints where to search..

we have " his own other accounts " and that means we have to look for his account in another social media platform but, there are plenty..
here comes the hint : eX-member..
as we know `X` is the new name of twitter so.. let's look for his twitter account :

As we see, there is indeed a twitter account for the "loco avocado" with the photo profile on internal ctf, now let's check..

checking his followers, tweets, likes, lists, there is nothing can lead us to find the flag but let's see closer his cover picture:
