# Look-O 2

> No no no!! we banned that crazy avocado so he doesn't spam our accounts but guess what! Now he's mentioning us in his OWN OTHER accounts!! 
What's that dedication?  I guess he's an eX-member.. I wonder what he's saying.

# Solution

This is part2 of this series of challenges.
In the first part, we found the flag in the YouTube account of "loco avocado".

But as I always say, the description can give us hints about where to search..

We have " his own other accounts " and that means we have to look for his account on another social media platform but, there are plenty..
Here comes the hint: eX-member..
As we know "`X`" is the new name of twitter so.. let's look for his Twitter account :

As we see, there is indeed a twitter account for the "loco avocado" with the photo profile on internal CTF, now let's check..

**You can check the profile from  [Here](https://twitter.com/LocoAvocado1)**

Checking his followers, tweets, likes, and lists, there is nothing that can lead us to find the flag but let's take a close look at his cover picture:

The flag is hidden there!
